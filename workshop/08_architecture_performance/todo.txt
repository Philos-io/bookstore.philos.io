1. Everything is a component:
  1.a Inside your book and core modules,  create a component folder and isolate directive component
    -- Put side by side the directive definition with its template and its controller
    -- The solution for this part is available in this folder so open it and try to replicate what has been done inside the book module

2. Reduce the number of watchers inside your app by using 'one time binding'
  -- {{title}} ==> {{::title}}

3. Add track by wherever needed (performance with ng-repeat)

4. Remove debugger information from your view before staging your app in production
  -- $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false)
  4.a Using 'angular.reloadWithDebugInfo()' you can have access to the debug info when your app is in production
