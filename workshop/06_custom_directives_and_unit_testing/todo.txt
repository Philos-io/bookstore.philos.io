1. Split the index.html into small components;
  1.a Create a Header component : 'bdp-header'
  1.b Create a Footer component : 'bpd-footer'
  1.c Create a main component for your application: <bookstore/>

2. Create a book component
  2.a It should be an element
  2.b It should have an isolated scope with a property 'book'

3. Rename book.html into search-book.html

4. Open the debugger tool and inspect your DOM
  -- The goal here is to understand how your app became human readable (kudos!!)
  -- Inspect your app with batarang to understand how your scopes are layout

4. Upgrade your application to angular 1.4.8

5. Create your own version of ng-hide and ng-show
  -- This directive hide or show an element on the DOM depending of the condition
  -- Call them bdp-show and bdp-hide
  -- They should be define as attributes
  -- Deep dive into the link function

6. Create your own ng-if (optional and difficult)
  -- This directive remove an element from the DOM when the condition is false and add it back when true
  -- Call it bdp-if
  -- It should be an attribute directive
